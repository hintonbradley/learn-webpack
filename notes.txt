What is webpack? 
A very configurable program that not only bundles-takes various different files (.png, .js, .css, etc) and bundles them into a smaller group of files, but it also manages dependencies-allowing files to be added where needed in your app.

Step 1: Initialize npm (create a package.json file)
    $ npm init -y
Step 2: Add a .gitignore file and add node_modules to gitignore file.
    node_modules
Step 3: Install webpack and webpack-cli as development dependencies
    $ npm i webpack webpack-cli
Step 4: Add start script to the package.json file.
    "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack"
    },
Step 5: Create a default entrypoint (index.js) in .src folder
    console.log('hello from webpack');
Step 6: Create a dist folder in the root directory
Step 7: In the index.html file, add a requires the main.js file in dist folder.
    <script src="./dist/main.js"></script>
Step 8: Add dist folder to .gitignore file
    node_modules
    dist
Step 9: Add all your dependencies to the index.js file so webpack can recognize and fetch from your app. (This is if we are not creating a separate config file - if no config file is created webpack automatically only looks in the index.js file for what to fetch.)
    import { run } from "./app/app";
    import { AlertService } from "./app/alert.service";
    import { ComponentService } from "./app/component.service";
    const alertService = new AlertService();
    const componentService = new ComponentService();
    run(alertService, componentService);
Step 10: To configure webpack, create a webpack.config.js file in the root folder and require path module.
    const path - require("path");
Step 11: Add following code to webpack.config.js file.
    // mode - default is production. if you want to run in development, you must add this key value (mode: development)
    // entry - an entrypoint for webpack to access your application
    // output - the file where the code should be outputted after webpack has completed compiling
    // path - node module allowing the application to create a file in a specific path wherever it's hosted.
    module.exports = {
        mode: "development"
        entry: "./src/index.js",
        output: {
            filename: 'main.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist")
        }
    }
Step 12: To write CSS, create a main.css file in your src folder, and write some styling.
Step 13: Install your loader necessary for CSS
    $ npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
Step 14: Add a loader for you CSS in your webpack.config.js file.
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: ["css-loader"]
            }
        ]
    }
Step 15: Make sure webpack knows about the css file by adding it to the index.js file.
    ...
    import { run } from "./app/app";
    import "./main.css";
    ...
Step 16: Add style-loader to your webpack.config.js file in order to take the css file that has been translated to javascript and add it to the DOM. Note: style-loader must come before css-loader in the array since webpack imports elements in reverse order.
