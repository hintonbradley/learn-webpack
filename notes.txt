What is webpack? 
A very configurable program that not only bundles-takes various different files (.png, .js, .css, etc) and bundles them into a smaller group of files, but it also manages dependencies-allowing files to be added where needed in your app.

Step 1: Initialize npm (create a package.json file)
    $ npm init -y
Step 2: Add a .gitignore file and add node_modules to gitignore file.
    node_modules
Step 3: Install webpack and webpack-cli as development dependencies
    $ npm i webpack webpack-cli
Step 4: Add start script to the package.json file.
    "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack"
    },
Step 5: Create a default entrypoint (index.js) in .src folder
    console.log('hello from webpack');
Step 6: Create a dist folder in the root directory
Step 7: In the index.html file, add a requires the main.js file in dist folder.
    <script src="./dist/main.js"></script>
Step 8: Add dist folder to .gitignore file
    node_modules
    dist
Step 9: Add all your dependencies to the index.js file so webpack can recognize and fetch from your app. (This is if we are not creating a separate config file - if no config file is created webpack automatically only looks in the index.js file for what to fetch.)
    import { run } from "./app/app";
    import { AlertService } from "./app/alert.service";
    import { ComponentService } from "./app/component.service";
    const alertService = new AlertService();
    const componentService = new ComponentService();
    run(alertService, componentService);
Step 10: To configure webpack, create a webpack.config.js file in the root folder and require path module.
    const path - require("path");
Step 11: Add following code to webpack.config.js file.
    // mode - default is production. if you want to run in development, you must add this key value (mode: development)
    // entry - an entrypoint for webpack to access your application
    // output - the file where the code should be outputted after webpack has completed compiling
    // path - node module allowing the application to create a file in a specific path wherever it's hosted.
    module.exports = {
        mode: "development"
        entry: "./src/index.js",
        output: {
            filename: 'main.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist")
        }
    }
Step 12: To write CSS, create a main.css file in your src folder, and write some styling.
Step 13: Install your loader necessary for CSS
    $ npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
Step 14: Add a loader for you CSS in your webpack.config.js file.
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: ["css-loader"]
            }
        ]
    }
Step 15: Make sure webpack knows about the css file by adding it to the index.js file.
    ...
    import { run } from "./app/app";
    import "./main.css";
    ...
Step 16: Add style-loader to your webpack.config.js file in order to take the css file that has been translated to javascript and add it to the DOM. Note: style-loader must come before css-loader in the array since webpack imports elements in reverse order.

Step 17: In order to use caching to our advantage (via html) we need to download the html-webpack-plugin
    $ npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
Step 18: Require the plugin in your webpack.config.js file.
    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
Step 19: Add your configuration for this plugin to the config file.
    plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin()],
Step 20: Add a template file in the src folder.

Step 21: Copy and paste code from index.html from root folder into the new template.html file in src folder. Be sure to delete the <script src="./dist/main.js"></script> line as it's no longer needed - wepback will now rewrite this line each time a change is made to the main.js file.

Step 22: In the config file, add configuration to the plugin so wepback recognizes which file to use as a template.

Step 23: In the config file, update the output value:pair so that it adds the hash created by webpack to the html file.
    ...
    filename: 'main.[contentHash].js',
    ...

***DEV & PROD CONFIG***
***********************

Step 24: Create two more config files in your root folder (webpack.dev.js and webpack.prod.js)
Step 25: Copy webpack.config.js code into both new config files
Step 26: Update the mode in each new file to match the name.
    mode: "development",
    &
    mode: "production",
Step 27: Change name of webpack.config.js to webpack.common.js
Step 28: In webpack.common.js file, remove the following:
    mode: "development",
    &
    output: {
        filename: 'main.[contentHash].js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist")
    },
Step 29: In webpack.dev.js file, update the code so it looks like this (complete):
    const path = require("path");
    module.exports = {
        mode: "development",
        output: {
            filename: 'main.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist")
        },
    }
Step 30: In webpack.prod.js file, update the code so it looks like this (complete):
    const path = require("path");
    module.exports = {
        mode: "production",
        output: {
            filename: 'main.[contentHash].js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist")
        }
    }
Step 31: In webpack.common.js file, keep all the code that is used by both prod and dev config files.
    const path = require("path");
    var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

    // mode - default is production. if you want to run in development, you must add this key value (mode: development)
    // entry - an entrypoint for webpack to access your application
    // output - the file where the code should be outputted after webpack has completed compiling
    // path - node module allowing the application to create a file in a specific path wherever it's hosted.
    module.exports = {
        entry: "./src/index.js",
        plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: "./src/template.html"
        })],
        module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test: /\.css$/,
                    use: ["style-loader","css-loader"]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
Step 32: In order to combine code from common and dev or prod, we need to install webpack-merge.
    $ npm i --save-dev webpack-merge
Step 33: Import common config file and webpack-merge into the dev and prod config files.
    const common = require('./wepback.common');
    const merge = require('webpack-merge');
Step 34: In your dev and prod config files, set module.exports to be a function call of merge with common as a parameter and the original object as the second parameter.
    module.exports = merge(common, {
        mode: ...
    });
Step 35: To tell webpack which config files to use, update the scripts in your package.json file.
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack --config webpack.dev.js",
        "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js"
    },
    ...
Step 36: Confirm dev is running correctly with npm start, and the dist/index.html file should only have main.js in the script. Additionally, that script in the dist folder should NOT be minified.
    $ npm start
Step 37: Confirm prod is running correctly with npm run build, and the dist/index.html file should have main[string].js in the script. Additionally, that script in the dist folder should be minified.

Step 38: Set up a dev server by first installing webpack-dev-server.
    $ npm i --save-dev webpack-dev-server
Step 39: In your package.json file update the start script.
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js --open",
Step 40: Confirm that a browser will open once you run npm start
    $ npm start
Step 41:
